		As a cashier I learned the value self-reflection and how to cope with setbacks.<br/>
		As a housekeeper, the value of personal & professional development.<br/>
		I wanted to be an animator, so I learned drawing & 3D modeling.<br/>
		Next a teacher, which taught me patience & empathy.<br/>
		Then a massage therapist, which taught me humility, the value of hard work & the universally appreciated skill of massage.<br/>
		But always, a game designer. A decade of reading & writing code & developing software have given me advanced pattern recognition skills.<br/>
		School taught me how to follow rules.<br/>
		Self-reflecting has led me to become more open-minded, to examine assumptions and find alternate solutions to problems.<br/>
