<p>Softly Into the Night</p>

<p>Fires and their lights are now working with ECS. There were so many bugs introduced in the switch from object-oriented to ECS style programming, that I&#39;m not sure if it will ever end.</p>

<p>I wish I could say I got more done this week, but there isn&#39;t much more to tell. I have been in debugging mode for a long time now, I need to get myself back in the headspace of developing the game.</p>

<p>Something I&#39;ve been meaning to get back to working on these past weeks is procedural content generation. So far, my game is really lacking on that front, as it&#39;s simply something I&#39;ve brushed aside to focus on other features. But the lack of procedural content is really starting to be more and more of a problem, and I really do want to get this game into a playable state ASAP, so I think that&#39;s my next big goal.</p>

<p>I probably won&#39;t be happy with the procedural generation for a really long time, but I think I need to get something done so I can have at least a few levels to playtest and start to get a feel for how the levels will be.</p>
