<p>These past few weeks I have been very busy and haven&#39;t had much time to work on Softly. This week, though, I did manage to get some work done. Mostly I did a lot of thinking about the game, as I usually do, but I&#39;ll spare you all of my crazy ideas and briefly go over what I actually achieved so far.</p>

<h4>body parts:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>equipment for all slots now affects stats.</li>

	<li>Status of each bone, muscle, organ now affects stats.</li>

	<li>Hydration is now stored as the mass of water in grams * 1000, to provide a finer scale for how hydrated you are. So 1 million hydration units == 1 liter.</li>

	<li>Satiation points are also now stored as calories rather than Calories A.K.A. KiloCalories (scaled again by a factor of 1000), to provide a finer scale of how satiated you are. 1000 satiation points is now 1 Calorie.</li>

	<li>body fat is stored as a floating point value rather than an int, because we don&#39;t care about precision. bodyfat =~= how many g of fat in the body.</li>

	<li>added more statuses for body parts (e.g. &quot;mangled,&quot; which means the body part is in utter ruin and is impossible to heal from).</li>

	<li>added a generic function to create humanoid body given a few parameters: mass, height, and a boolean: female?</li>
<ul>


<h4>hunger/thirst:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>added homeostasis, digestion, metabolism functions</li>

	<li>Homeostasis regulates body temperature and induces shivering or sweating if necessary.</li>

	<li>Digestion converts food you have consumed into calories and hydration points, using a simple status effect that indicates how much food you have consumed.</li>

	<li>Metabolism consumes those satiation/hydration points and induces starving/dehydration if you have insufficient points.</li>

	<li>Starving causes you to lose body fat until you run out, at which point you begin losing strength in your muscles and suffering from other status effects.</li>
</ul>


<h4>statuses:</h4>

<ul><li>added sweat, shiver statuses, implemented them in the Status Processor / Homeostasis Processor</li></ul>



<h4>resistances:</h4>

<p>made all resistances have the same scale: -99 to infinity. 0 is default where you take 100% damage. The formula for damage is dmg = 100/(100 + resistance). So at 100 res you take 50% damage, at 200 you take 33%, 400 res = 20% damage, etc. At -99 obviously you&#39;d take 100x as much damage as usual but such a low resistance is difficult to achieve in most cases.</p>



<h4>tools:</h4>

<p>added 1-2 more levels of quality for most tools for finer levels of detail, removed cap on quality for all tools. There is no limit to how good a tool can potentially be.</p>



<h4>IO:</h4>

<p>added more commands - attack-prompt and move-prompt, which prompt the user for a direction in which to force-move or force-attack.</p>

<p>Standard move command for directional input is now called context-dir which is like a generic context-sensitive directional input, which can of course result in several different actions like attacking a monster you bump into, or opening a door, or moving somewhere, or moving and then picking up some money lying on the floor, etc.</p>

<h4>chargen:</h4>

<p>working on a random character generator that requires very little input from user to roll a new character from scratch</p>

<p>player generator updated to use new components and humanoid body gen function</p>

<h4>items:</h4>

<p>items now have encumberance stat instead of just draining your Movement Speed straight up. Encumberance is a stat that is dependent on mass in that the displayed value in-game is encumberance * mass.</p>

<p>all weapons and armor updated with new encumberance values, removed old MSp values</p>

<p>generally speaking, one-handed weapons are less encumbering than before, while two-handed weapons and large shields are more encumbering.</p>

<h4>bestiary:</h4>

<p>began moving monster data into an excel file for ease of access and updating as compared to the current method of storing the data in hard-coded Python dicts. May attempt something similar with items / weapons / armor, but for those I will have to write a script to do it automatically since there are so many items.</p>

<h4>rogue (glue file):</h4>

<p>moved functions out of rogue and into modules to reduce the amount of top-level functions (non-wrapper functions) in rogue.py</p>

<h4>weapons:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>changed the two-handed policy for weapons: now the bonus for wielding 1-h weapons in 2 hands is (edit: NOT) dependent on the skill class required to wield it.</li>

	<li>created a UI mockup for weapons display in the inventory (example here)</li>
</ul>

<h4>attributes:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>3 attributes added to the current 3 (which are intelligence, strength, constitution): dexterity, endurance, and agility.</li>

	<li>Dexterity: ++ speed of attacking; ++ speed of doing anything with your hands. ++ throwing range. ++ grip, grappling, disarming. ++ crafting.</li>

	<li>Endurance: ++ stamina maximum, stamina regeneration. ++ resistances to physical, bleed, pain, heat, cold, bio.</li>

	<li>Agility: ++ movement speed, ++ attack speed with melee weapons, ++ DV (dodge value); -- penalty for moving on difficult terrain (makes it easier to traverse obstacles without losing speed).</li>

	<li>Also considering adding &quot;luck&quot; but maybe only for the player character.</li>

	<li>All attributes are now stored in-game as factors of 10x the displayed value, to provide a finer scale for changes in attributes. The displayed (and mechanically used) value is the floor of the stored value /10. The same change has been applied to most stats.</li>
</ul>


<p>NOTE: With the change in scale of stored stats, now equipping a hat that appears to give 0 protection might actually increase your displayed protection by 1. Higher intelligence may allow you to see the actual value as a decimal representation i.e. 125 stored Str == 12.5 displayed Str. But only each whole point actually makes any difference in the mechanics.</p>

<p>NOTE: I felt that endurance should be separate from constitution which grants increased health and maximum encumberance. Otherwise the attribute would be far too OP if it upgraded all those stats -- all of them are going to be very important. Agility, too, seemed to need to be distinct from hand-agility or dexterity -- agility functions as your general / movement agility while dexterity is your hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, etc.</p>

<p>Edit: formatting</p>

<p>EDIT 2:00pm EST</p>

<p>status effect timers for all statuses, and stat mods for some of them; some new stat mods, new status effects e.g. &quot;full&quot; from overeating</p>
