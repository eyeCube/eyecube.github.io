<p>Softly Into the Night</p>

<p>This week, I continued to get everything working with the new ECS system including all the hundreds of new items. The past couple of days I have been focused on just getting the game to run again; I&#39;m to the point where the entire character generation phase works, and I&#39;m feeling very close.</p>

<p>Again, I have plans to release Softly at the end of this year, though that may be pushed back a couple months as needed since I am very busy with school, etc.</p>

<p>Edit: earlier today I managed to get the game to run with no errors! But, the player still couldn&#39;t see and the whole screen was black. Unfortunately I won&#39;t be able to do much more work on the game until tonight, and then I will try to get that fixed, too. Getting sooo close.</p>
