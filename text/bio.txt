As a cashier I learned the value self-reflection and how to cope with setbacks.
As a housekeeper, the value of personal & professional development.
I wanted to be an animator, so I learned drawing & 3D modeling.
Next a teacher, which taught me patience & empathy.
Then a massage therapist, which taught me humility, the value of hard work & the universally appreciated skill of massage.
But always, a game designer. A decade of reading & writing code & developing software have given me advanced pattern recognition skills.
School taught me how to color inside the lines and jump through hoops.
Self-reflecting has led me to become more open-minded, to examine assumptions and find alternate solutions to problems.
